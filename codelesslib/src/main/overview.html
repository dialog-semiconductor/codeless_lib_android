<!--<h1>CodeLess&trade; Android Library Documentation</h1>-->
The CodeLess&trade; library implements the Renesas CodeLess&trade; and DSPS protocols and provides
helper classes to support the development of your own CodeLess&trade; and DSPS applications.

<p>
Import the <code>codelesslib</code> library module into your Android Studio project.
You can use the SmartConsole Android application source code as reference.
</p>

<p>For more information on how to use the library, refer to the following documentation pages.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use {@link com.diasemi.codelesslib.CodelessScanner} to scan for Bluetooth devices.</li>

    <li>{@link com.diasemi.codelesslib.CodelessCommands} contains helper methods for sending various AT commands to the peer device.</li>
    <li>{@link com.diasemi.codelesslib.CodelessEvent} contains event classes for all possible events that can be generated by the library.</li>
    <li>{@link com.diasemi.codelesslib.CodelessProfile} contains definitions and helper classes and methods.</li>

<b>Note:</b>
There is also a CodeLess&trade; library for iOS development, which is written in Objective-C.
While class names may be slightly different and the API uses the Objective-C syntax, the iOS
library behavior is similar to the Android one, except for some platform specific cases.
